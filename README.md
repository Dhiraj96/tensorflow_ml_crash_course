# tensorflow_ml_crash_course
A re-work of the Machine Learning Crash Course offered by Google using the Tensorflow high level Estimator API.
I used a virtual environment to set up and run the Jupyter Notebooks locally. The information on packages used and 
how the environment was set up is located within the Virtual_Env_Setup.rtf file with basic directions. 

I am currently using macOS High Sierra and used Brew to download my Python as well as the dependencies on my local
machine. Do note that these directions may differ based on the environment the reader is currently working with
and may require additional external resources to download and run the notebooks locally.
